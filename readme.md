# Introduction

This is our backend that process the data from the browser extension. It is connected with our tigergraph instance. For the
data processing we use basic string operations and spacy for nlp tasks.
Moreover it is able to execute some queries from tigergraph that can be send to a frontend to use it in graph framework like: https://g6.antv.vision/zh

### Install Instructions:

1. Install all requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install spacy:
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
3. Change config.py data to your tigergraph instance

## Project

/scripts: Here find a script to extract the domain knowledge dataset to a file
that can be used for tigergraph mapping. It splits every relation in one
